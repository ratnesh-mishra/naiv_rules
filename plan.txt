1.Evade complexity for now, think in simple terms

2. If it can't be better than if/else , its not worth doing

3. Forward/Backward chaining may be avoided for practical purposes

4. Try out with a set of decorators sitting upon actions

5. Figure out way for setting up priority based evaluations(can be devised somehow using meta or superclasses/ factory dudes)

6. Adding new rules should be straight forward and at a proper priority

7. Simple is not foolish :)

Long shots --

1. Addition of new rules can be done objectively , from db or something with no or minimal code change or release

2. Re-evaluation can be avoided in all scenarios (Redis may help)

3 . Think of more possible improvements
